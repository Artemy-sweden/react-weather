          <span className="red">Hi</span> there! I'm Artemy, the creater of
          Weza. I'm a junior web developer & freelancer & a little bit designer.
          There should be a link to my <a href="#">github</a> , but for some
          reason it was eaten by my cat)
        </p>
        <p>
          [Weza] is a pet-project on ReactJS which shows a weather in real-time
          up to 7 days. Here u can see forecast in ur city and almost in every
          city u know. Just type the right cityname into the search box and
          enjoy the result. All data is real and updates every moment.
        </p>
        <p>I think, this information will be enough to fill this field;)</p>
